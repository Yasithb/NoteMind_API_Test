# 🧠 NoteMind API Testings

This repository contains my **Postman API testing collection** for the **NoteMind** project —  
an **AI-powered Note Management System** built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and OpenAI API integration.  

I created this collection to test and validate all backend endpoints including authentication, user management, note handling, and AI summarization.
